* How to Contribute

** Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub. Include:
- Your Emacs version.
- Your =auth-source-sops= configuration.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Expected vs. actual behavior.

** Proposing Enhancements

Feature requests are welcome. Please open an issue to discuss your ideas before implementing them.

** Development Setup

This project uses [[https://github.com/alphapapa/makem.sh][makem.sh]] to simplify building, linting, and testing.

*** Requirements
- Emacs 28.1 or later.
- =sops= executable.
- =bash= (for running =makem.sh=).

*** Running Linters and Tests
Before submitting a pull request, please ensure that all linters and tests pass:

#+begin_src bash
# Run all linters and tests in a sandbox
./makem.sh -vv --sandbox all
#+end_src

You can also run specific rules:
#+begin_src bash
# Run only tests
./makem.sh -vv --sandbox test

# Run only linters
./makem.sh -vv --sandbox lint
#+end_src

* Standards

** Code Style
- Use standard Emacs Lisp indentation.
- We use =apheleia= or =indent-region= to maintain consistent formatting.
- CI enforces indentation via =makem.sh lint-indent=.

** Documentation
- All functions and variables should have descriptive docstrings.
- Follow the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Documentation-Tips.html][Emacs Lisp Documentation Tips]].

** Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Reference issues where appropriate.

* Releasing

This project uses automated Git tagging. To release a new version:
1. Update the =;; Version:= header in =auth-source-sops.el=.
2. Push or merge the change to the =main= branch.
3. The CI workflow will automatically create and push a new Git tag (e.g., =v1.0.1=) if the tests pass and the tag does not already exist.
